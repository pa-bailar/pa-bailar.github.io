// Visit statistics with GoatCounter (https://www.goatcounter.com): no cookies and no personal data, so
// no consent banner is needed. Page loads are counted by its script (layouts/BaseLayout.astro); this
// adds what a static page can't see on its own:
//   - each event opened (or swiped to) in the viewer, as a visit to that event's page;
//   - clicks on the actions marked with data-track="<name>" (Instagram, WhatsApp, sharing…).
// GoatCounter ignores localhost, so local testing isn't counted. If its script is blocked, nothing breaks.
